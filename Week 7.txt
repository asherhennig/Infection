- Worked on getting my menus to load through a script instead of having it rigged through Unity, Previously I ran into a problem where the scenes were not 
being loaded through the script. I later found that I was attempting to load prefab of that instance and therefore could not load the game objects as the
function cannot properly reference a prefab. I solved this by putting a debug.log that checked the size of the gameobjects to see what was being stored,
the output was 0 as the script could not get a reference to the gameobjects.

-Made a temporary button that loads the post wave stats screen with code
	- Added a continue button to keep playing after displaying the stats
